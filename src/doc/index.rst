What is it?
===========

Sandify is working on a solution to turn your
  cold, empty hearted, emotionless sand tables into
  cold, empty hearted emotionless sand table robots with enchanting patterns.

Sandify is a labor of love, but if you'd like to support me financially,
  I do have a <a href="https://liberapay.com/jeffeb3">Donation</a> system set up. Or just <a href="https://www.paypal.me/jeffeb3">PayPal</a>.

Sand Machine
============

Anything that uses gcode (or thr files) can be used with sandify.
  But the machine this was designed for is the ZenXY from V1Engineering.com:

 - `ZenXY on V1Engineering.com <http://www.V1Engineering.com/zenxy/>`
 - `ZenXY Thingiverse Page <https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2477901>`

ZenXY was inspired by the awesome Sisyphus Kinetic Art Table by `Sisyphus Industries<https://sisyphus-industries.com/>`, which is also now supported.

Sandify was created by users in the `V1Engineering.com Forum<https://www.V1Engineering.com/forum/topic/does-this-count-as-a-build/>`
