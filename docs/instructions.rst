Shapes
======

The shapes tab will take a shape and repeat it, over and over. Each time it repeats the shape, it
will change it a little, so a lined shape becomes a pattern that covers a large area.

Input Shapes
============

You can click on any of the shapes, and see what it will look like in the preview window. Some
shapes have options, which will show up when you select that shape.

Polygon
-------
The polygon is used for triangles, squares, pentagons, and you can choose the number of sides.

Star
----
The star is a star, and you can choose how many points, and how deep the points are.

Circle
------
The circle starts out as just a circle, but if you change the number of lobes, it's like twisting a
rubber band, and you'll get more waves in the circle.

Heart
-----
The heart is a heart shape.

Text
----
The text will let you set a phrase, and Sandify will use this instead of a shape.

Starting Properties
===================

Starting Size
-------------
This is the scale of the shape in the first loop.

X, Y Offsets
------------
This determines the center of the shape in the first loop.

Modifiers
=========

Each time the shape is repeated, you can control how it gets modified.

Number of Loops
---------------
This determines the number of times the shape will be repeated.

Grow
----
Each loop, the shape will grow. Larger Growth Steps will make each loop grow more. Smaller steps,
combined with more loops, will create a denser design.

Spin
----
Each loop, the shape will spin around the center of the area. Shapes like stars create very
interesting patterns just by growing and spinning. Circles aren't interesting to spin, unless they
are combined with an X or Y Offset.

The Switchbacks will allow the pattern to switch back and forth from CW to CCW several times while
performing the loops.

Negative Spin Steps will cause the design to spin the other way.

Track
-----

The Track will move the center of the shape each loop around the middle. This can be used to keep a
shape the same size, but have it's location move around the machine to cover more area.

The Grow button under the Track options makes the track grow each step, so it will spiral out from
the middle.

The Track Size is the distance the track starts from the center, and the Track Step is the distance
around the circle for each step. To make the shape rotate around the area faster, increase the track
step. To make it circle farther from the center, increase the track size.
