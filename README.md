# Still a work in progress.
It's in the very infant stages, or, no one has taken the time to update this.

## Sandify 

Sandify is working on a solution to turn your cold, empty hearted, emotionless sand tables into cold, empty hearted emotionless sand table robots with enchanting patterns.

AFAIK, the steps to replicate this on your machine are:

 - Install npm and node.js
 - Run 'npm install' from here
 - Run 'npm start' and it should open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:3000

When we want to "deploy" the website, we can do so with 'npm run deploy' command. So much magic.
