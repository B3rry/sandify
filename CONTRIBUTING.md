## How to contribute

Sandify grows from community contributions. We'd love to collaborate with you. Here are some ways we
can improve together:

### Share Patterns

Even though we've spent a lot of time developing sandify, the patterns it can create suprise even
us. If you have used sandify to make a pattern, please share it, and share how it was done. We get
motivated seeing the impacts. Other users get inspired.

### Report Issues

Report bugs, feature requests, errors in the [issue
tracker](https://github.com/jeffeb3/sandify/issues). We can't test every scenario in every release
on every system. Many of the best ideas for features have come from issue requests.

### Contribute Code

Sandify has never been a one person effort. @jeffeb3 owns the project and guides the effort, but
most of the code has been written and rewritten by contributors. It is a pleasure to
work on, and we welcome collaboration.
